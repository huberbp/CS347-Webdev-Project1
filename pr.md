1. What did you like about this website?

I liked the overall bright and clean nature of the website. The background gave the website
a modern feel, but wasn't too in your face to the point where it becomes distracting. I liked the
footer at the bottom of the page. I think that it was the right place to place information like the
report and credits. I think the pictures that you used where bright and sharp. This gave the website
a profesional feel.

2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.

I think the biggest difference between our two sites is the appearance of them. Mine has a more
dated feel, while Ben's is much more modern. I think this is because of the white backgrounds
as opposed to the solid color backgrounds of mine.

    1. Which has a better user experience (and why)?

    I think that our user experiences are similar. However, I think that your home page is a little clunky.
    The only reason I say this was because your already have a navigation bar, so it feels a little
    awkward for it to have the navbar reiterated on the homepage.

    2. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?

    I think that Ben's codebase is probably more managable. It's more simplistic
    and has a similar style for each of the pages. This makes it easier to have
    css files with repeating elements. Depending on my page, I had a variety of different
    elements.

3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?

The html code is very neatly laid out in files with clean spacing and indentation. The images
and css are both in their own files. 

    1. if not, suggest some specific improvements

4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.

    1. were semantically appropriate elements selected

    I think everything that needed to be given a class or id was given one. The only exception
    was some HTML element like h1, but I don't think you normally given them ids.


    2. is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?

    Your CSS is refactored nicely and is very compact. The only issue I see
    with your CSS could be it being difficult to navigate around and find stuff.
    Maybe comments that denote where different sections start and end could be useful.

5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    
I think that your website would benefit from some more pictures and information.
Besides the homepage, the other pages feel a little repetitive and could
use some more lively elements.
