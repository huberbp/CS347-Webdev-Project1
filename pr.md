# Peer review (Vivian Stewart)

1) What did you like about this website?
    I like how the background of the website has texture: the criss crosses with a stage head in them. I also like how clean and simple it looks. It is easy to navigate and I like the shadow on the header and footer.

2) Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.
    A significant difference between my P1 site and Ben’s P1 site is that he kept a more consistent style across all pages. I think this is better for the user's experience because they can expect consistency. 

3) Which has a better user experience (and why)?
    I think that my website has a better user experience because there are more images, animations, and things to keep the user engaged. 

4) Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?
    I think that Ben’s code base would be more maintainable because everything keeps a consistent style and therefore it would be easier to add new pages and maintain the old ones. 

5) Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?
    The code is well structured within files and directories. All the images are in a folder labeled “images” and the css code is in a folder labeled “css”.

6) Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.
    I did not find any issues with the website. 
        a) were semantically appropriate elements selected
            Semantically appropriate elements were selected. All the names were descriptive and made sense to me.
        b) Is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?
            CSS duplication was limited. There was only one CSS file shared among all the html files. 
            
7) Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?
    Overall, the website is great. I think it would be a good idea to make the font in the footer bigger when it is on a mobile device.
